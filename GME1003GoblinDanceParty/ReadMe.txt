how many of steps 1-6 you got completed
I completed all 6 steps.

how you decided when it was appropriate to commit/push your changes
Every time I finished a task, I committed and pushed.

how many commit/pushes you executed
The plan was only 6, but I forgot to add a read me file so I had to commit/push a total of 7 times.

any specific troubles you had with GitHub or with completing the assignment
Other than trying to figure out how to sign into Visual Studio with GitHub, everything worked smoothly.

how you used AI, if you did
Since AI was permitted, I used it to help me with my code, and to understand how to navigate the the Visual studio
interface when comitting and pushing my code to GitHub.
